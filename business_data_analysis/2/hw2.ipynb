    "3) It seems that `Passenger Fare` is total among all passengers with the same `Ticket Number`: create new attribute `Single passenger fare`. For every passenger you need to compute the number of passengers with the same `Ticket Number` and then use this number as a divisor for `Passenger Fare`. \n",
    "Do not drop the original attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Impute missing values: for numerical attributes use averaging over three groups: `Passenger Class`, `Sex`, `Embarkation Port`; for every numerical attribute create separate column that contain 1 for imputed value and 0 for originally presented. \n",
    "This step is mainly for practicing your groupby/join skills. In real tasks this kind of imputation is relatively rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Pre-process categorical attributes: For every categorical attribute create a separate column that contains 1 for a missing value and 0 for originally presented. One-hot encode categorical attributes with less than 20 unique values, drop other categorical attributes; drop original (that you pre-processed during this step) attributes. \n",
